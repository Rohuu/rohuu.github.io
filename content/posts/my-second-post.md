# Why Hibernate is the preferred choice?

1. In today's technology-driven world, databases are the backbone of almost every software application. Database connectivity is a crucial component of any application development. The most commonly used database connectivity technologies are JDBC and Hibernate. While JDBC has been the traditional method of connecting to a database, Hibernate has emerged as a popular alternative. So, what makes Hibernate the preferred choice over JDBC? Let's explore.

2. Hibernate provides concrete classes that provide the boilerplate logic.
JDBC is an API that provides only interfaces and abstract classes, which means developers have to write their own implementation of these interfaces. In contrast, Hibernate provides concrete classes that provide the boilerplate logic. This saves developers a lot of time and effort and makes their code more efficient and maintainable.

3. Hibernate's exceptions are unchecked, unlike JDBC's checked exceptions.
In JDBC, all classes throw checked exceptions, which means developers must handle these exceptions or declare them in the method signature. Hibernate, on the other hand, uses unchecked exceptions, which means developers don't need to handle exceptions that are unlikely to occur.

4. Hibernate takes care of resource management.
In JDBC, developers have to manage resources like closing connections and other resources. However, there may still be a chance of memory leakage. In Hibernate, the resource management is taken care of by Hibernate itself, which makes developers' work a lot easier.

5. Hibernate's class and column names are not tightly coupled.
In JDBC, the table and column names are tightly coupled with the application. This means that any change in the database requires developers to modify the code, which incurs development and testing costs. However, in Hibernate, the class names and columns are not tightly coupled with the classes. These are configured with a mapping file (an XML file). If there is a change in the database, developers can modify the mapping file instead of changing the code, saving time, money, and energy.

6. Hibernate stores objects directly, while JDBC cannot.
Hibernate can store objects directly in the database, while JDBC cannot. This makes Hibernate more user-friendly and easy to use.

7. Hibernate supports versioning.
If a record (object) is modified multiple times, Hibernate can identify how many times the object or record has been modified. This feature is known as versioning and is not available in JDBC.

8. Hibernate supports lazy loading.
Hibernate supports lazy loading, which means that data is loaded only when it is required. This can save a lot of memory and improve application performance.

9. Hibernate supports caching mechanisms.
Hibernate supports caching mechanisms that can significantly improve the performance of an application.

10. Hibernate supports database-independent queries (HQL).
Hibernate supports HQL, which is a database-independent query language. This makes it easy for developers to write queries that can work with any database.

11. Hibernate supports generators.
Hibernate supports generators that can generate unique primary keys for database tables. This is a useful feature that simplifies the task of managing primary keys.

In conclusion, Hibernate offers a wide range of benefits over JDBC. From reducing development and testing costs to providing better resource management and supporting caching mechanisms, Hibernate is a powerful tool that every developer should consider. By choosing Hibernate, developers can create more efficient, scalable, and maintainable applications that provide a better user experience.
